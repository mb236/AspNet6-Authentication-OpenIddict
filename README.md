# AspNet6-Authentication-OpenIddict

This repository contains an experiment to replace the Identity Server parts of the original ASP.NET Core 6 Angular Template (with Individual Authentication option) with OpenIddict.
Due to the [license change](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-6-and-authentication-servers/) running Identity Server 5 (which is bundled in the template by default) in production requires a license. 
Therefore the goal with this experiment is to conduct how difficult it is to do the replacement task.
